6. Clutch (do they pull through in pressure situations?)

*Statistics*

1. Batting Average = contact, consistency
2. On Base Percentage = pitch intuition, consistency
3. Slugging Percentage (total bases/at bats) = contact, baserunning, power
4. Isolated Power (amount of extra bases with a hit) = baserunning, power
5. Stealing Percentage = baserunning
6. Ground-Out to Fly-Out Ratio = contact, power
7. Ground-Ball to Fly-Ball Ratio
8. Wins Above Replacement = consistency
9. Pitches per Plate Appearance = pitch intuition
10. Walk-to-Strikeout Ratio = pitch intuition
11. Plate Appearances (to normalize) = consistency
12. Runners in Scoring Position = clutch, contact
13. Sacrifice Hits = contact
14. Late Inning Pressure Situation = clutch
